Been in the business for almost 1 year. He is open to technology that can help his business<p><p>What do you think of cashless?<p>Cost<p>why pay more to sell such simple items $3 $5 chucken rice? Not worth it. Most of the hawkers here are price sensitive.<p><p>Most of the items sold is small ticket items. <p><p>Accounting<p>Some smy studebts did a survey here regarding an app to help them with the accounting of their stocks (how much supplies left, number of food sold etc), but most do not want it because they find it a hassle to key into the app.<p><p>They just take note of how much supplies they have left at the end of the day. They dont need the exact amount, just agar agar and its relatively easy.<p><p>The supplier can deliver everyday. Some stalls here order supplies everyday, and the supplier only accepts cash.<p><p><p>How long did it take for you to get use to the hawker life?<p>“It took me 6 months to properly guage how much to order and sell. What i will do is i will write down my sales and stocks avail per day on a calendar, then i will analyse and see if  there are any trends weekly or monthly.”<p><p>Kampung spirit<p>“One thing i didnt know about hawker centres when i first started is the kampung spirit. This is the only place in Singapore you will ever find that still has kampung spirit. We always plan and hold some event like karaoke or bbq or some ones hse to celebrate things like 7 month, or lantern festival. When i first started the others stores were all very welcoming, they all immediately ordered from me and gave me feedback on my food. They also gave me alot of advices.”<p><p>“Would hygiene or space be and issue if you are planning to get a cashless system?”<p>Hygiene and space is not really an issue for him. Cos he already pre cooked the beef stew the food. So he just need to pour and does not need to do alot of preparation. Other stalls maybe, cos they need to handle soup, cook the noodles etc etc. They scared dirty, then wear gloves, but in the end they use the gloves to touch the money.<p><p><p>Fear of technology<p>Old generation tend to avoid using technology<p><p>Older generation would usually follow the younger generation in terms of adopting technology.<p><p>“Older generation is afraid of change. Even if you tell them, i can make your payment system better faster for free, they will say no. they will say" i have been doing this for 10 to 20 years, and got no problem, so what for i change?"<p><p>“You should target the younger generation first, because we will be more receptive to it, since we are new, and we want all the help we can get. To me, technology generally still makes things easier, so any survey ppl will come to me.”<p><p>Any problems faced with cash?<p>I wanted to try NETS actuslly, cos i thought i would stand out among the stalls here. But eventually i did not because i had not much peoblems with cash. The only problems maybe is loose change was annoying to calculate.<p><p>(Thoughts)<p>Perhaps targeting the drink stalls would be a start, since they are the once dealing with the smallest ticket items around here, and therefore your most problematic audience. Maybe they could be most receptive to it to, since they are dealing with coins it becoms heavy to carry and difficult to calculate.<p><p>How often do customer ask for cash?<p>In 10 months, only 5 customers ask me if can use NETs. So i dont ser the demand. If customers want it, then i will consider.<p><p>“The others are very niao about how much they earn one. They want to know how much they earn on a daily basis, and do not want to wait for the cash to come in. They do not want their money to be tracked, because they feel they are not trusted with the money they earn.”<p><p>Of course technical difficulties also another reason why hawkers dont want. Machine spoil call customer service, most customer service also not very efficient. Take very long to pick up and come down also. Need to take additional step to fix.

But if 1% of my customers demand for it, then it's not worth it. It's the hassle of having a system to cater for a small percentage. However if got 80% of my customers using cashless then yah okay I'll get one just so it's convenient for my customer" <p><p>"If I get a system I'll need infrastructure like wifi or wired connection or something. That involves space and hassle if connection breaks down. "<p><p>"Older hawkers want to feel the money in their pocket . Especially the Chinese ones. It's a habit and it's hard to break. When they put their hand in their pocket they wanna feel the cold hard cash cos it's a feedback to them that they've worked hard. It's their reward. "<p><p>Holding charge <p>" Why must you hold my money. My hard work. You hold it for 1 month and then meantime how do I survive. How do I pay my employees and suppliers.

Each payslip processed would cost a service charge of $5. (Payslip describes the cash segments in the bag. Eg $1000-rent, $2000-sales)<p><p>Theft has happen before in other koufu outlets, with the cash bags going missing, but it is not often.<p><p><p>Bank Account<p>Current bank account is OCBC, but manager want to change it to UOB. This is due to the payslip service charge he and the floor staff has to absorb. Each payslip he has to pay $5 service charge, and every month it accumulates tp $600. This $600 is deducted from his and the employees bonuses. Their bonuses come in every 6 months.<p><p><p>He is following the steps of The Gallerie. Gallerie has low sales and is suffering from a rats problem. When they changed their bank to UOB, they had alot of savings. (Find out more about this)<p><p><p>Every koufu stall may have a different bank account from each other. It is based on the manager’s request, and the finance department will think about it.<p><p><p><p>	<p><p><p><p>Stall Management<p>Mostly owners, but have some are workers.<p>Koufu has no interaction with the stall’s suppliers. The suppliers usually coming everyday, and for SMU’s case, the stall needs to have cash to pay the supplier per delivery. For other people, they would usually pay the supplier an end of the month settlement.<p>Some resources like egg,fruits are supplied by the same supplier shared among the stalls.<p>They sometimes change their menu, especially when its summer break for SMU students.<p><p><p>Customer Management<p>Discrepancies are mostly due to wrong discounts, or misommunication, the food itself etc.<p>Example: There was a time where a customer give $5 but thought she gave $50. She did not believe even after seeing the CCTV, and therefore had a conflict with the stall owner.<p><p><p>Any discrepancies, the floor manager has to report to the department manager within 24 hours, and the department manager will reply the customer within 48 hours (from the time of contact with floor manager).<p><p><p>Boss (Pang Ling)<p>Does not want to copy others<p>Operation manager proposed a prepaid top up card like kopitiam to him before, but pang ling said dont want to be copy cat.<p><p><p>Friends with Kopitiam, Food Republic, Food Junction boss<p><p><p>Had considered using the dash phone app when it was launched the other time, but because the stall owners didnt want it, he wasnt up for it.<p>Who to serve first? If lets say the one customer hands out cash to order, another shows the phone app to redeem, who do i serve first? This situation would cause another customer to be happy if I choose either one, especially if both queues are long.<p><p><p>Open to ideas, but to convince him, most important thing is that stall owners are up for it.<p><p><p>Will go to outlets with very bad sales like the one in kallang<p>Nobody, no traffic.<p><p>POS System<p>2 types - Digital and Punch Key. Both serve the same purpose, which is used for closing statement and for transparency of sales to branch manager.<p>Punch Key<p>Easy to use, everything can be reset by a master key. Not prone to technical errors. However, has a limit to the number of menu items they can store (fixed buttons) therefore whatever that is not recorded as a menu item on the pos system due to lack of space, is recorded as (open price). Then this causes a situation where the stall owner does know what exactly has been sold.<p><p><p>Digital<p>Once spoil, need to contact technician, very troublesome. However, since its easier and more flexible (no open price) thats why they rather use this than the traditional one.<p><p><p>Loopholes of POS System in Food Junction:<p>Customer pays $4<p>Merchants keys in amount and opens cash register<p>Merchant put in $4 and half close the register (pretends to close)<p>Next customer pays $5<p>Merchants pretends to key in and pull out cash register<p>Merchant puts in $5 (merchant cannot keep in the wallet now cos got cameras)<p>(Repeat repeat)<p><p><p>Once the cash register is fully closed, only the $4 sale will be registered.<p><p><p>During cash collection, merchant takes all cash and goes to a blind spot before submitting the cash to the managers office. He takes out the extra sales that he did not register and keep it as his own.

Their partnership with DBS enables merchants to enjoy free rental of the DBS terminals. Also, the demographic of customers here are mostly technology-savvy students who are more inclined to using card payments.<p><p>Background: Been operating for close a year. It is a family business, managed by a 40-50 year old auntie and uncle who are married. <p><p>SUTD Goumet Habitat ( Almost 1 year Old)<p>Initially they only accepted cash, but because many student request them if they can pay by cards, they set up the NETs system. They wanted to minimise transactions, so they placed a minimum amount of $20 if you wanna pay by NETs. However due to many instances of students not hitting the minimum amount by still request for cards, they decided to do without the minimum amount.<p>Auntie would say around 50% of students pay with cards, because they don't have cash.<p>Extra transaction charges to the auntie, charged by NETs. Out of $5, nets charged them a transaction fee.<p>Card more convenient for the merchant. Counting the money is a hassle.<p>Special queue in ATMs for corporate to deposit account, therefore easier for corporates.<p>SUTD encourages cashless transaction, and they have the added benefit of DBS helping them to set up the terminal and rent it for free, although they still need to pay a portion of from each transaction to DBS.<p>DBS helps to pay the set up cost and the terminals except NETs. Everyday the NETs terminal need to log in, but it’s easy to log in. <p>It was not hard to learn how to use the terminal..<p>Pay cash/cheque face to face with supplier. Supplier declines credit/debit because the trust between them is not established yet. Supplier scared merchant will run away.<p>After every transaction, they keep the physical receipt produced, and then use it to tally with the stocks later for closing statement<p>There is a chargeable rate by banks if people wants to change notes for coins with them. Therefore, small changes like these are preferred to be obtained from their circle of friends, but it is inconvenient.<p>Sometimes the consumer keys in the pin incorrectly, then need to restart the system again. At cases like this, cash will be faster. <p>Don’t have to give change to consumer when they pay by card.<p>Reduce the costs of the terminal, would make it even better.<p><p>School rental is cheaper than external area.<p><p><p><br><a href='#_3.2_F&BSoloCashless_GourmetHabitat+b'>Back<a><br><br><hr><p align='center'><b><font color='blue' size='+2'>1 Coding of <a id='_3.2_F&BSoloCashless_MufMuf'>"_3.2_F&BSoloCashless_MufMuf" from 1 file </a></b></font><hr><p align='left'><b><font color='red'> Int_3.2_MufMuf [0:989] </font></b><br><br>Muf Muf<p>Location: United Square 2 Novena<p><p>Background: Talked to the chef.

They are still in the midst of settling down, as they are currently in the process of setting up cashless payments with NETs and credit card companies.<p><p>“The increase in space was the biggest problem we had when we moved here. We had a lack of manpower to oversee the space. Currently, only have 4-5 staff on the ground, 2 runners, 1 cashier and 1 manager.”<p><p>“There was quite alot of money missing initially due to cash handling. That’s why we are pushing for NETs terminal, but they haven’t replied to us yet. Its been a week”<p><p>“Previously, the NETs terminal we used was connected to the landline. However, we havent set up the landline yet, so we opted for the portable one. Another issue with using a landline was that when somebody called in, then we cannot process any NETs payment since it is connected to the same landline.”<p><p>“We are considering credit cards also, but are still browsing the best rates through Seans (owner) contacts”<p><p>“We accepted AMEX previously, but we realise many customers dont have AMEX. They always ask for mastercard or visa. Therefore, we have decided if the terminal don’t offer mastercard or visa, then we dont offer anything, even if they have higher rates than AMEX”.<p><p>“Customers that spent alot during their meals tend to use AMEX”<p><p>“The account that is linked with NETs is a DBS account. We chose DBS because it seems like they had the best benefits. I think they got give free cheques or bank books, something like that haha”<p><p>“Our supplier deliver everyday. They mainly receive by cash or cheque. However, some of them are beginning to accept credit cards, because it’s quite inconvenient when we have to pay them by cash or cheque when they come, especially when they come during peak hour. (Peak hour 11-3, 7-9). They are more incliined to accept credit cards because we have been dealing with them for quite long already.”<p><p>“Whenever there’s a tally offset during closing statement, we have to fork out our own money.
